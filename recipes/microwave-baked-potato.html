      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        When you're short on time or patience, waiting an hour or more for an oven-baked potato might seem like a tall order. That's why this recipe is so darn good â€“ you can have
        a perfectly microwaved baked potato in just a little more than 10 minutes! It sounds too good to be true but, we promise, this recipe is just as good as reviewers say it
        is.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheddar</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>

          <h3>Prep Potato</h3>
          <p>Scrub your potato under running water, prick it with a fork, then place it on a microwave-safe plate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Cook and Cut</h3>
          <p>
            Microwave for about 5 minutes, flip it over, and microwave it for about 5 more minutes. Let the potato cool for just a few minutes, until it's safe to handle. Cut the
            potato lengthwise so that it opens and forms a natural bowl.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Finish With Toppings</h3>
          <p>
            Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then mash the inside with a fork. Top with butter and Cheddar, then return to the microwave to melt the cheese. Finish it with sour cream
            and the toppings of your choice.
